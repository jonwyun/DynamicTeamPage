Dynamic Team Page

1. Use arrays to show and hold team membersâ€™ bio
2. Use lightbox or hamburger menu pop-up method in CSS to show the bio details on top of the index page  
3. To get back to the index page from pop-up, use close button
4. Will look for a way to use Javascript to change images constantly on the left side of the index page(-> this plan cancelled as the design changed)
